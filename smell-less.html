                  <h2>A Rose by any other name.... still won't
                  smell like anything.</h2>
                  <p>
                  I've been alive 28 years, and without smell for potentially
                  all of them. When I was young, I believed that smell was very
                  much a learned ability, a skill. I thought that if I just sat
                  down and reaally worked on smelling I could be as good as my
                  friends, who could tell what we were having from lunch just
                  sniffing the air briefly.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Gradually I figured that the must be something wrong with my
                  sniffer. I went to the family doctor, and eventually got a catscan
                  which provided us with no medical reasons why I couldnt smell.
                  The best explanantion the specialist could give my mother and I
                  was that I had had a horrible cold as a youngster that knocked
                  out the nerve endings in my nose.

                  <h2> Living in a Smelly City, and Being "Nose-blind" </h2>
                  <p>I've lived in Cedar Rapids for 24 years. Throughout those long,
                  hard years I have heard millions of complaints from my peers and
                  fellow Cedar Rapidians about the scent of the air in a variety of
                  exotic locations throughtout the city. </p>
                  <p>
                      Observing peoples reactions to external stimuli that I am
                      completely oblivious to is pretty amusing. In this city, more
                      often than not innocent citizens are clutching their noses
                      and letting loose horrible barks of disgust. I calmly ask them,
                      "What ever is the matter?" After we get past the fact that
                      I am inexplicably impervious to the noxious smell particles,
                      I often ask them to describe their emotions and their opinion
                      on the origin of the particular smell. </p>

                    <p>
                      All in all, being nose-blind and living in Cedar Rapids, Iowa
                      is kind of a hoot. It would be kind of like being a duck living
                      in Seattle, or a ball of fire living in Death Valley, never
                      understanding the suffering around you.
